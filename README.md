# Meta-Prompting Framework  
*A practical framework for building structured reasoning systems with large language models.*

---

## Overview  
This repository accompanies my public **Meta-Prompting Series**, which explores how prompting evolves into full reasoning architecture.  
The framework demonstrates how to design, test, and refine prompts that guide LLMs through explicit layers of context, logic, and reflection—producing consistent, auditable results.

---

## Why It Matters  
Most prompt examples stop at *“what to ask.”*  
Meta-Prompting defines *“how AI should think.”*  
By layering context, reasoning, and self-evaluation, we move from reactive text generation to **designed cognition**—AI that reasons transparently and improves through iteration.

## Framework Structure  

| Layer | Purpose | Example |
|-------|----------|---------|
| **Base Layer** | Establish context, tone, and constraints | “You are an analyst; follow ethical rules and explain reasoning.” |
| **Instruction Layer** | Execute the main task | “Analyze this data and summarise 3 insights.” |
| **Refinement Layer** | Review and optimise its own output | “Re-check your logic and flag speculative claims.” |
| **Memory Layer** | Maintain continuity across sessions | “Recall prior conclusions and adapt the next step.” |

Together, these layers form the **Meta-Prompt Circuit**—a self-referential reasoning workflow.
